== It depends

When you work with Java and RDBMS "It depends." is the correct answer for a lot of things. How to achieve a certain thing depends typical on

* the type of RDBMS you are using
* the version of the RDBMS
* the configuration of the RDBMS
* the JDBC driver
* it's version
* and lots of intricate details of how to use the JDBC API.

With lots of googling you probably can find out about these things. But wouldn't it be nice to have a single place where can find all these variants, complete with example code?

This project tries to achieve this.
It has infrastructure to run a test in many different variants against many different databases.
And it will collect a growing collection of these tests and hopefully eventually publish them to a website.
